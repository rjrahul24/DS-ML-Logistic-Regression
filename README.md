# DS-ML-Logistic-Regression
Machine Learning using Logistic Regression: Whenever the variable that needs to be predicted requires a "binary" solution to the problem, we use Logistic Regression. This repository contains a project that will use Logistic Regression to determine whether a passenger; given their features could have survived the Titanic Crash.
