# Logistic Regression on the Titanic Dataset (Top 6% on Kaggle)
Machine Learning using Logistic Regression: Whenever the variable that needs to be predicted requires a "binary" solution to the problem, we use Logistic Regression. This repository contains a project that will use Logistic Regression to determine whether a passenger; given their features could have survived the Titanic Crash.

Follow the following steps to implement any ML algorithm:
1. Perform Exploratory Analysis to understand the data given
2. Look for any missing values or discrepancies in the data and address those
3. Use the most optimal function to replace missing values
4. Clean the data further
5. Perform ML algorithms
6. Compare between algorithms to choose the best result
