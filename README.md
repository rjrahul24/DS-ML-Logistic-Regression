# Logistic Regression on the Titanic Dataset (Top 6% on Kaggle)
Machine Learning using Logistic Regression: Whenever the variable that needs to be predicted requires a "binary" solution to the problem, we use Logistic Regression. This repository contains a project that will use Logistic Regression to determine whether a passenger; given their features could have survived the Titanic Crash.

Follow the following steps to implement any ML algorithm:
1. Perform Exploratory Analysis to understand the data given
2. Look for any missing values or discrepancies in the data and address those
3. Use the most optimal function to replace missing values
4. Clean the data further
5. Perform ML algorithms
6. Compare between algorithms to choose the best result

The Challenge
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
